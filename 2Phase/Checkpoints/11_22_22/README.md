## Probability

### Probability Exercises

Given the following probabilities:

$P(A) = 0.7$

$P(B) = 0.5$

$P(B|A) = 0.4$

Calculate the probabilities described in Question 1 and Question 2. Rather than "hard-coding" an answer, try to show your work by adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing the original probabilities, e.g. `0.2*0.1` rather than just writing `0.02`

Hint: draw a diagram if you're getting stuck!

#### Question 1: $P(A and B)$
    
Assign your answer to the variable `ans1`


```python
# CodeGrade step1
ans1 = None
ans1
```


```python
# ans1 should be a floating point probability between 0 and 1
assert type(ans1) == float
```

#### Question 2: $P(A|B)$
    
Assign your answer to the variable `ans2`


```python
# CodeGrade step2
ans2 = None
ans2
```


```python
# ans2 should be a floating point probability between 0 and 1
assert type(ans2) == float
```

### Probability Theory

#### Question 3: True or false: $P(A or B)$ is always equal to $P(A)$ + $P(B)$


```python
# CodeGrade step3
ans3 = None
ans3
```


```python
# ans3 should be a boolean
assert type(ans3) == bool
```

## Card Combinatorics

A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards in each of the four suits of spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Each suit contains 13 cards: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King.
    
You have a standard deck of 52 cards and are asked the following questions:

Answer the questions below:

#### Question 4: What is the probability of drawing a King or a Queen?

Assign your answer to the variable `ans4`


```python
# CodeGrade step4
ans4 = None
ans4
```


```python
# ans4 should be a floating point probability between 0 and 1
assert type(ans4) == float
```

#### Question 5: How many possible 5-card combinations can be formed with this deck of 52 cards?

Assign your answer to the variable `ans5`


```python
# CodeGrade step5
ans5 = None
ans5
```


```python
# ans5 should be a number greater than 1
assert type(ans5) == int or type(ans5) == float
```


```python

```
